# App_Streamlit_Churn
 Customer Churn Prediction...
  # project description
In the this project we herness to embed some of the machine learning  models  into a web application with a user friendly interface. we are to develop a customer churn prediction application using a streamlit library in python.

 # PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1.Build a Streamlit app to embed the classification model you built a few weeks ago.
2.Create a dashboard to display visualization of data available in youdatabase.

 # GOAL OF PROJECT
To deploy the machine learning model that was trained in a previous project. In that project we analyzed customer churn rate and built classification models to perform churn analysis on a telecommunication company's customers. This project gives users the chance to interact with the model by inputing variables for the model to predict if customer will churn or not.
